# Hi! I'm Muhammad Rafli Baihaqi

I am an 8th-semester student at Udayana University majoring in Computational Mathematics.

in this project, I created a simple web bookstore. To run it, you need to install PHP 8.1 and Composer 2.6.5 and follow these steps

1. Clone of this repository
2. go to the root folder

```bash
cd /timedoor-test-2024
```

3. install some dependencies by copying the following commands in the terminal

```bash
composer install
```

4. create a new file .env and provide data like .env.example

5. generate dummy data with the following command

```bash
php dummy.php
```

6. run the server with the following command

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```

then open the web page on
http://127.0.0.1:8000 or http://localhost:8000
